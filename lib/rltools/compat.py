"""Shared Revit-version compatibility helpers for RL Tools.

These helpers exist because the Revit API changed shape over the supported
range (2015-2026): ``ElementId.IntegerValue`` and the ``ElementId(Int32)``
constructor were removed in Revit 2026 in favor of ``Value``/``Int64``.
Keeping the fallbacks in one place stops the copies in individual tools from
drifting apart - version-compat code is exactly where a divergent copy
becomes a Revit-release bug.

Import from pushbutton scripts as ``from rltools.compat import ...``; the
extension ``lib`` folder is always on pyRevit's ``sys.path``.

Deliberate exceptions that keep local copies instead of importing this
module: library modules that the test suite loads standalone without the
``rltools`` package (for example ``coordination_review_passive`` and the
``*_state`` companions), because the import would fail under that loader.
